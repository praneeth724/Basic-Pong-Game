## Description
In this project, you'll create a basic version of the classic arcade game Pong. This exercise will help you understand ball physics, paddle movement, and simple AI behavior. By the end of this project, you'll have a functional Pong game with single-player mode, complete with scoring and ball movement mechanics.

## Mechanics
- Ball physics
- Paddle movement

## Systems Involved
- Rigidbodies, colliders
- Basic physics
- AI paddle for single-player mode

## Steps
1. Create a new Unity project and add a 2D scene.
2. Create paddles and a ball using 2D sprites.
3. Add Rigidbodies and Colliders to the paddles and ball.
4. Write a script to control the player paddle using keyboard input.
5. Implement basic AI for the opponent paddle.
6. Add a script to handle ball movement and bouncing off paddles and walls.
7. Add scoring zones and a score counter.

## Existing Game Examples
- Pong (classic arcade gameplay)
- Breakout (paddle and ball mechanics)
